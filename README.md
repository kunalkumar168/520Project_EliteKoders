# Introduction
-------------------------------------
The Patient Tracker System is an intuitive, web-based digital solution designed to transform patient care within healthcare facilities. By providing a seamless platform for healthcare providers to efficiently track patient records, schedule appointments and manage treatment plans, the system aims to streamline healthcare processes and improve patient care.

This app is the project from CS520 class at UMass Amherst in Fall, 2023. The goal is to develop a patient tracker app that provides a patient login into the system, view doctors, book/modify/cancel appointment etc and a doctor can also login into the system, see all patients assigned under them, update patient prescription etc.

We are using Client-Server Design pattern. The architechture diagram for the app is :

The functional requirement covered in this project are :

1. As a doctor, I want to view the list of patients scheduled for the day so that I can prepare for the consultations.

2. As a doctor, I want to view a patient's medical records before the consultation so that I can provide the best care possible.

3. As a doctor, I want to upload prescriptions electronically on the server so that the patients can check it.

4. As a doctor, I want to create and modify treatment plans for my patients so that they have a structured approach to their recovery.
